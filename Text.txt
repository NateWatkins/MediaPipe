We will find the most volitil moment in the video using the joint velocity information and we want to be able to pull the frame which that is found.  
TO be able to do this we will probably need a seperate
function or another file.

WE also want to find the momement of greatest change in the velocity of the joints

This is later in combination with other factors
.

Get everything to run first on rgb frmaes 
Frist 200 frames cut it down

Try on different model parameters track differences, and report it 

We will have csv outputs 

Have a time series plot and see whethere there is a change in curvy 



WHere are we now
WE have the segmentation Mask outputed into the right folder.
We have graphs and charts based on position and velocity
WE will get the shadows for the filtered and unfiltered data
Already a preliminary README but I will add a new one for the progress we have made so frame
