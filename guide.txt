Takes in the joint full names

Uses _build_allwlist_cols(df,bases)
 - Return a data frame of x,y,z points of each joint

Rejection issue. 
We need to find the peaks of the signs either by looking at the time slot of the frames 

Get the space press and the next one and only plot on the that time window

Plot by a flexible x axis for time

When I get both graphs I will need to 


viedo not synced and it is not real time 

approximation about where the wirte up area 

near 0 velocities are better for the 


large Data set with all the finformation with all the features
dont segment the features wriet about mediapipe


Write up about the context of the paramters and then a lyamans terms
 how have you used mediapipe to get the outputs that we gotten


 Play around with the ELAN data and figure aout exportation and link the informatino with the movement
